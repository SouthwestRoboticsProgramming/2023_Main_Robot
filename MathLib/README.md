# MathLib

The MathLib project aims to make frequently used math, such as operations on angles and vectors quicker to implement, and more reliable.

#### Angle
The Angle package aims to increase the consistency of angle measurements by forcing an absolute direction and adding units.
This makes it much less likely to  mess up clockwise vs counterclockwise.
